### :mortar_board: Academic background

My academic background is quite technical. 
I got my High School diploma in Electronics and Telecommunication from the I.T.I.S "G. Segato" in Belluno (Italy). 
Following this I got my Bachelor degree in Electronics and Telecommunications engineering from the University of Trento (Italy) and a Master's Degree in Bioengineering from the University of Padova (Italy).


### :information_source: Volunteering

Outside of the academic world I like to volunteer in some local organisations of my home town, in particular 
* :ambulance: I have been a volunteer EMT and ambulance since I became 18, and since a couple of years I also obtained my instructor accreditation.
* :drop_of_blood: I am a volunteer in a local organisation which promotes blood donation since I became 18.
